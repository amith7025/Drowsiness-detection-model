# Drowsiness Detection Model using YOLOv5 and PyTorch

## Overview

This repository contains a drowsiness detection model based on YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, and implemented using PyTorch. The model is designed to identify signs of drowsiness in images and video frames, making it suitable for applications such as driver monitoring systems.

## Features

- **YOLOv5-based Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 for efficient and accurate object detection.
- **Facial Landmarks Detection:** Integrates dlib to detect facial landmarks for drowsiness analysis.
- **Real-time Drowsiness Detection:** Provides real-time detection of drowsiness based on facial landmarks.
- **PyTorch Implementation:** Utilizes the PyTorch deep learning framework for flexibility and ease of use.
- **Webcam Integration:** Easily integrates with webcam feeds for live monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- dlib
